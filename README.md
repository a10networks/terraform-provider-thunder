Maintainers
-----------

This provider plugin is maintained by the Cloud team at [A10Networks](https://www.a10networks.com/).

Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 1.0.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 (to build the provider plugin)


Building The Provider 
-----------------------
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:a10networks/terraform-provider-thunder.git
$ make build
```

Building The Provider in Go Work-Space
----------------------------------------

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/a10networks/
$ cd  $GOPATH/src/github.com/a10networks/
$ git clone git@github.com:a10networks/terraform-provider-thunder.git
```
Build the provider

```sh
$ make build
```

## Local Plugin Installation

For Thunder plugin Installation without fetching it from A10 Networks Namespace.  

Inside your cloned repo; here x.y.z is version example 0.4.5
1. $ go build -o terraform-provider-thunder
2. $ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/a10networks.com/a10networks/thunder/x.y.z/linux_amd64/
3. $ cp terraform-provider-thunder ~/.terraform.d/plugins/a10networks.com/a10networks/thunder/x.y.z/linux_amd64/
4. create version.tf file like:-
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    thunder = {
      source  = "a10networks.com/a10networks/thunder"
      version = "x.y.z"
    }
  }
}
```

If you face some dependency issue try "$ go mod tidy" or "$ go mod vendor"

Note:- After cloing you can also run ```$ make local ``` to perform these above step automatically for dummy version 7.7.7 in Linux env.

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make bin
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-thunder
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

## Samples
See the examples directory for various LB topologies that can be driven from this terraform provider.
