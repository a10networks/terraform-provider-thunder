## How to Search Thunder Configuration

To search for a Thunder Configuration in the existing examples, perform the following steps:

  1. Search the required Terraform configuration script directory navigate to examples > resources directory.

      **Example:**

      If you want to apply the bgp router configuration on Thunder, search for the thunder_router_bgp directory under the resources directory.

  2. Open the Terraform script from the directory.

      **Example:**

      Open resource.tf script under the thunder_router_bgp directory.

  3. Update the Thunder IP address and login credentials depending on the type of Thunder installed and review the Thunder configurations in the Terraform script.

```
provider "thunder" {
    address = var.dut9049
    username = var.username
    password = var.password
}

resource "thunder_router_bgp" "bgp1" {
    as_number = 101
    neighbor {
        ipv4_neighbor_list {
            neighbor_ipv4 = "10.1.1.104"
            activate =  1
            nbr_remote_as = 104
            allowas_in =  1
            allowas_in_count =  10
            graceful_restart =  1
        }
    }
}

resource "thunder_router_bgp" "bgp2" {
    provider = thunder.L3V_A
    as_number = 201
    neighbor {
        ipv4_neighbor_list {
            neighbor_ipv4 = "10.1.1.204"
            activate =  1
            nbr_remote_as = 204
            allowas_in =  1
            allowas_in_count =  10
            graceful_restart =  1
        }
    }
}

```

4. Add, modify, or remove the Thunder configuration parameters and their corresponding values as appropriate.

5. Save the changes.

6. Identify the compatible Terraform Provider version for your installed ACOS version from Support Matrix Section.

7. Go to [A10 Networks Terraform Thunder Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/a10networks/thunder/latest/docs).

8. Select your Terraform Provider version from the Latest Version drop-down.

10. Copy and paste the following Terraform Provider configuration from the USE PROVIDER drop-down to your Terraform script.

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    thunder = {
      source = "a10networks/thunder"
      version = "1.4.2"
    }
  }
}
```

11. Save the Terraform script.


## How to create new terraform thunder configuration example.

  Here are step-by-step instructions for creating a terraform thunder configuration example.
  For example if you want to apply bgp router configuration on thunder and which doesn't exist in examples.

1. Create a new directory to house your terraform configuration files.

```
  mkdir thunder_router_bgp
  cd thunder_router_bgp
```

2. Create a `.tf` file, such as `thunder_router_bgp.tf`, in your "thunder_router_bgp" directory. In this file, define the  Thunder ROUTER BGP configurations using the A10Networks Thunder Provider. Refer to the official documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/a10networks/thunder/latest/docs/resources/router_bgp  for the required resource and parameters.

   Here is basic example:
  ```
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        thunder = {
          source = "a10networks/thunder"
          version = "1.4.2" # Replace with your desired provider version
        }
      }
    }

    provider "a10networks" {
      host          = "10.10.10.10" # Replace with your desired your thunder device ip
      username      = "admin"    # Replace with your desired your thunder user name
      password      = "password"    # # Replace with your password
    }

    resource "thunder_router_bgp" "thunder_router_bgp" {
    as_number = 101      # Replace with your desired bgp number
    neighbor {
      ipv4_neighbor_list {
        neighbor_ipv4 = "10.1.1.104"   # Replace with your desired neighbor_ipv4 address
        activate =  1                  # Replace with your desired activate value
        nbr_remote_as = 104            # Replace with your desired nbr_remote_as value
        allowas_in =  1                # Replace with your desired allowas_in value
        allowas_in_count =  10         # Replace with your desired allowas_in_count value
        graceful_restart =  1          # Replace with your desired graceful_restart value
          }
      }
    }

  ```
  Adjust the BGP configuration parameters as needed.

## How to execute TTP Configuration from Terraform CLI

To apply the Thunder Terraform configurations using Terraform CLI, perform the following steps:

## How to contribute

If you have created a new example, please save the Terraform file with a resource-specific name, such as "thunder_bgp.tf."

1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy the newly created file and place it under the /examples/resource directory.
3. Create a MR against the master branch.

### Pre-requisite

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 1.0.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 (to build the provider plugin)


### How to Build The Provider

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:a10networks/terraform-provider-thunder.git
$ cd terraform-provider-thunder
$ make build
```


### Local Plugin Installation

After building new provider we need to install and test the plugin.

We need to create a new version please follow below step.

  1. $ cd terraform-provider-thunder
  2. $ go build -o terraform-provider-thunder
  3. $ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/a10networks.com/a10networks/thunder/7.7.7/linux_amd64/
  4. $ cp terraform-provider-thunder ~/.terraform.d/plugins/a10networks.com/a10networks/thunder/7.7.7/linux_amd64/
  5. create version.tf file like:
  ```
  terraform {
    required_providers {
      thunder = {
        source  = "a10networks.com/a10networks/thunder"
        version = "7.7.7"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

If you face some dependency issue try `$ go mod tidy` or `$ go mod vendor`

*Note:* After cloning you can also run `$ make local` to perform these above step automatically for dummy version 7.7.7 in Linux env. Else if you have already executed manual steps please ignore this.

 If raise MR request for contributing.
