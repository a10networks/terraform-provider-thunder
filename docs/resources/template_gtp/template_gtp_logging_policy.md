- `crosslayer_correlation` (Number) Logging Packet Drop due to mismatch in IP address and GTP FTEID/GSN address
- `gtp_in_gtp_filtering` (Number) Logging Packet Drop due to GTP in GTP filtering
- `invalid_header_check` (Number) Logging Packet Drop due to Invalid Header checks
- `invalid_teid_check` (Number) Logging Packet Drop due to Invalid Tunnel Endpoint Identifier
